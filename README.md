# R-Ladies Utrecht. Program 2021

It is time to start a new series of meet-ups for 2021. Here is a first draft of the topics we expect to cover. For now it is just the result of a WhatsApp brainstorming session and nothing is set on stone. We will however try to get the speakers and dates for them.
